# Algo-Analyser
To design and develop a performance visualization tool that analyzes algorithms based on time and memory usage.
To allow users to select and run different algorithms with varying input sizes or parameters.
To measure real execution metrics (not theoretical) and store them for comparison.
To visualize results graphically through plots showing time vs. input size and memory vs. input size.
To provide an interactive and educational platform that helps users understand algorithm efficiency and scalability.
